Personal Finance V.1.0
===========================
Intro
-------
Users can casually note down their daily spending on a text editing app on their smartphones or personal computers. Users will use a single .txt file to do so.

At the end of each day (midnight) the app will back up the note into a folder with the backup date as the file name. **V.2.0**

How to use
-------
This app requires an account with a file hosting service such as Dropbox or Google Drive and your computer must be synchronised with it.
